"在世代繁衍過程中，住在非洲陽光飽和緯度地區的人類適應成為有較多黑色素生產量，及較多的真黑素，使皮膚呈現較深色。","Over the course of generations, humans living at the Sun-saturated latitudes in Africa adapted to have a higher melanin production threshold and more eumelanin, giving skin a darker tone."
"當皮膚暴露於紫外線下，會觸發特殊的感光受體 ─ 稱為「視紫質」，它會刺激黑色素的產生， 以免細胞遭受破壞。","When it's exposed to UV light, that triggers special light-sensitive receptors called rhodopsin, which stimulate the production of melanin to shield cells from damage."
"這是一個問題， 因為雖然紫外線會損傷皮膚，但它也帶來同等重要的好處。","This was a problem because although UV light can damage skin, it also has an important parallel benefit."
"紫外線可幫助我們身體產生維生素D，一種強化骨骼並讓我們吸收重要礦物質的成分，如鈣、鐵、鎂、磷酸鹽和鋅。","UV helps our bodies produce vitamin D, an ingredient that strengthens bones and lets us absorb vital minerals, like calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphate, and zinc."
"經過數代的物竸天擇，在那些地區的人膚色逐漸變淡。","Over many generations of selection, skin color in those regions gradually lightened."
"對那些能有效阻擋所有陽光的皮膚黝黑者而言，當他們到北方時，維生素D缺乏會造成嚴重的威脅。","For humans whose dark skin effectively blocked whatever sunlight there was, vitamin D deficiency would have posed a serious threat in the north."
"其核心是「黑色素」，賦予皮膚與頭髮顏色的色素。","It all centers around melanin, the pigment that gives skin and hair its color."
