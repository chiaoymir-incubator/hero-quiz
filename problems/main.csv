"蘇菲派為伊斯蘭教日益激進化的直接替代性選擇, 再次廣受歡迎。","Sufism has seen a resurgence in popularity as a direct alternative to the growing radicalization of Islam."
"但蘇菲派的禁慾、非暴力實踐能否抑制伊斯蘭激進主義的蔓延仍待觀察。","But whether the ascetic, nonviolent practices in Sufism can overcome the spread of radical Islam is yet to be seen."

"了解這個明顯矛盾的關鍵，在於考慮你處理的情況類型中，涉及的不確定性的整體水平。","The key to understanding this apparent paradox is in considering the overall level of uncertainty involved in the type of situation you're dealing with."
"但有時候，愈開始接近達到全體同意，出來的結果反而愈不可靠，這就是所謂的「一致性矛盾」。","But sometimes, the closer you start to get to total agreement, the less reliable the result becomes. This is called the paradox of unanimity."
"知道這一切，一致性辨識開始看起來不太像一定有罪，反而比較像系統性誤差，或是對行列中的人帶有偏見。","Knowing all this, a unanimous identification starts to seem less like certain guilt, and more like a systemic error, or bias in the lineup."
"事實上，一份 1994 年的研究發現有高達百分之四十八的目擊者，會從行列中指認出錯的人。","In fact, a 1994 study found that up to 48% of witnesses tend to pick the wrong person out of a lineup."
"當你這樣看時，一致性矛盾並不總是那麼矛盾。","When you look at it this way, the paradox of unanimity isn't actually all that paradoxical."
"但是，在我們有理由預期一些自然變異的案例中，我們也應該預期有不同的分配。","But in cases where we have reason to expect some natural variance, we should also expect varied distribution."
"畢竟，我們的社會通常採多數表決和共識決議，無論是政治、商業或是娛樂。","After all, much of our society relies on majority vote and consensus, whether it's politics, business, or entertainment."

"但是 DNA 證據如此一致，正是因為它是錯的。","But the DNA evidence was so consistent, precisely because it was wrong."
"其他的案件中，系統性誤差是舞弊的結果，像是 2002 年，由 Saddam Hussein 舉行的總統全投，宣稱獲得百分之百的投票率和支持率，成功獲得七年總統任期。","In other cases, systematic errors arise through deliberate fraud, like the presidential referendum held by Saddam Hussein in 2002, which claimed a turnout of 100% of voters with all 100% supposedly voting in favor of another seven-year term."
"理論上, 全體同意仍然最理想的情況，尤其是預期變異性和不確定性機率很低的案例，但實際上，在不大可能的情況下獲得全體同意，則顯示也許影響系統的隱藏因素。","Unanimous agreement is still theoretically ideal, especially in cases when you'd expect very low odds of variability and uncertainty, but in practice, achieving it in situations where perfect agreement is highly unlikely, should tell us that there's probably some hidden factor affecting the system."
"儘管我們會爭取和諧和共識，在許多情況下，錯誤和不一致是再自然不過的事。","Although we may strive for harmony and consensus, in many situations, error and disagreement should be naturally expected."

"某程度來說她同意我們，可是她不確定目擊者可不可靠。","She agrees with us up to a point, but she's not sure the witness is reliable."
"那長官應該是對的，畢竟目擊者是靠著記憶挑出嫌疑犯的。","I guess the chief is right, since the witness picked the suspect out based on her memory."
"是沒錯。總是有點風險。","That's true. There's always a risk."
"就算沒有目擊者，證據和監視器畫面都證明那個人有罪。","Even without the witness, the evidence and the camera footage prove this guy is guilty."

"此外，一般人獨處時都會比較自在。","Additionally, people in general feel less self-conscious when they're alone."
"這種焦慮感不一定會隨著獨處消失，因為他們會在腦中反覆思考可能會發生的糗事。","And the anxiety doesn't necessarily go away when they're alone, because they let situations play over and over in their heads, contemplating what might have gone wrong."
