"在世代繁衍過程中，住在非洲陽光飽和緯度地區的人類適應成為有較多黑色素生產量，及較多的真黑素，使皮膚呈現較深色。","Over the course of generations, humans living at the Sun-saturated latitudes in Africa adapted to have a higher melanin production threshold and more eumelanin, giving skin a darker tone."
"當皮膚暴露於紫外線下，會觸發特殊的感光受體 ─ 稱為「視紫質」，它會刺激黑色素的產生， 以免細胞遭受破壞。","When it's exposed to UV light, that triggers special light-sensitive receptors called rhodopsin, which stimulate the production of melanin to shield cells from damage."
"這是一個問題， 因為雖然紫外線會損傷皮膚，但它也帶來同等重要的好處。","This was a problem because although UV light can damage skin, it also has an important parallel benefit."
"紫外線可幫助我們身體產生維生素D，一種強化骨骼並讓我們吸收重要礦物質的成分，如鈣、鐵、鎂、磷酸鹽和鋅。","UV helps our bodies produce vitamin D, an ingredient that strengthens bones and lets us absorb vital minerals, like calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphate, and zinc."
"經過數代的物竸天擇，在那些地區的人膚色逐漸變淡。","Over many generations of selection, skin color in those regions gradually lightened."
"對那些能有效阻擋所有陽光的皮膚黝黑者而言，當他們到北方時，維生素D缺乏會造成嚴重的威脅。","For humans whose dark skin effectively blocked whatever sunlight there was, vitamin D deficiency would have posed a serious threat in the north."
"其核心是「黑色素」，賦予皮膚與頭髮顏色的色素。","It all centers around melanin, the pigment that gives skin and hair its color."
"其一是「真黑素」，它會導致各種棕色調皮膚及黑色、棕色和金色的頭髮，另外就是「褐黑素」，它會導致紅棕色的雀斑和紅髮。","There's eumelanin, which gives rise to a range of brown skin tones, as well as black, brown, and blond hair, and pheomelanin, which causes the reddish-browns of freckles and red hair."
"始於 5 萬多年以前，當時我們的祖先從非洲往北遷移到歐洲和亞洲。","It began some 50,000 years ago when our ancestors migrated north from Africa and into Europe and Asia."
"那麼我們祖先怎麼應付紫外線的攻擊呢？","So how did our ancestors cope with this onslaught of UV?"
"這與生俱來的遮陽罩使他們不易罹患黑色素瘤，使他們演化以更適應居住環境，並將這個有用的特質傳給後代子孫。","This built-in sun shield helped protect them from melanoma, likely making them evolutionarily fitter and capable of passing this useful trait on to new generations."
"由於我們祖先的適應能力，今天地球充滿了各種不同膚色的人，通常富含真黑素的深膚色者居住在炎熱、陽光充足的赤道附近，而隨著陽光的減少，富含褐黑素且膚色漸淺者則由此區呈扇型向外擴散。","As a result of our ancestors' adaptability, today the planet is full of people with a vast palette of skin colors, typically, darker eumelanin-rich skin in the hot, sunny band around the Equator, and increasingly lighter pheomelanin-rich skin shades fanning outwards as the sunshine dwindles."
