"雖然從後來的視角來看也許難以想像，但是在 20 世紀 20 年代，一種批判性觀點預測有聲電影這項技術新玩意將會迅速淡出人們的視線，就像之前--追溯到第一次世界大戰之前--多次試圖將畫面與錄音連在一起的技術那樣。","Though it may be difficult to imagine from a later perspective, a strain of critical opinion in the 1920s predicted that sound film would be a techincal novelty that would soon fade from sight, just as had many previous attempts, dating well back before the First World War, to link images with recorded sound."
"當地小規模的有關友誼、禮拜和生產的平等主義的或類似平等主義的組織在放任自由的環境中繁榮發展，在這樣的多元化中，個體之間可以在和諧和意識形態平等的社群中互相影響，追隨他們普選出來的領袖，透過共識實現自我管理，同時將財富和權利差異最小化。","In the multiplicity of small-scale local egalitarian or quasi-egalitarian organizations for fellowship, worship, and production that flourished in this laissez-faire environment, individuals could interact with one another within a community of harmony and ideological equality, following their own popularly elected leaders and governing themselves by shared consensus while minimizing distinctions of wealth and power."
